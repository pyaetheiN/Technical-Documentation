            NFTs has become a hot topic as of late 2021. 
            Before we explore deeper about NFTs, you should know that
            it's not a new thing it's been around for years... 
            So, what are NFTs? NFT stand for Non-fungible token.
            A non-fungible token is a non-interchangeable unit 
            of data stored on a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, 
            that can be sold and traded. Types of NFT data units may 
            be associated with digital files such as photos, videos, 
            and audio.

            To simplify things up, a non-fungible token (NFT) is a 
            unique digital asset that represents ownership of real-world
            items like art, video clips, music, and more. NFTs use the 
            same blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies, but 
            they're not a currency.
