            Before any creation, a planning phase is crucial to carry
            out all the requirements effortlessly and that's where 
            roadmaps come in.
            A nft roadmap is a strategic planning tool used to set
            desired outcomes, milestones, and high-level tasks to
            release a product into the marketplace. While not all
            successful nft projects require one, they help set
            purpose and intent for both the creators and nft
            holders who buy into the collection.
          </p>
          <p class="section__text">
            NFT roadmaps usually include key project milestones,
            short and long-term goals, and plans for marketing and
            growth. It is the same as with regular businesses. It
            needs a clear vision and mission. We need to look at how
            it is built up and how much effort was given to putting
            the pieces together.
          </p>
          <p class="section__text">
            Following along the roadmap, you not only need a plan on 
            <a class="read-more" href="market.html">marketing</a>
            but also blockchain developers to run the project. 
            <a class="read-more" target="_blank" href="https://www.betterteam.com/blockchain-developer-job-description">
            Developers in this field</a>
            use their basic understanding of JavaScript and 
            Python to build smart contracts with Solidity and Rust (programming 
            languages for smart contracts / blockchain)
          </p>
          <p class="section__text">
            Lastly, you need a <a class="read-more" target="_blank" href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/nft-marketplaces">marketplace</a> 
            to deploy the project. Before choosing an NFT marketplace, you'll first want to decide the kind of digital asset you're interested in 
            buying, selling, or creating. Just about anything digital -- the written word, videos, video games, art, collectors items, etc. -- can 
            be tokenized on a blockchain (such as <a class="read-more" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum">Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH)</a>, the most common blockchain network NFTs are built on), so narrowing down 
            your interest is a good place to start.
            Another consideration is the type of tokens supported on a marketplace. Some support a wide variety of tokens. Others are closed marketplaces
            and utilize a specific proprietary token. When opening an NFT marketplace account, be sure to fund your blockchain wallet with the right crypto 
            or token required to participate in the site's activity. You'll be prompted to link your wallet to the NFT marketplace once you've opened up an 
            account. Also check to see what kind of security the marketplace has in force, and if it has had any issues in the past.
